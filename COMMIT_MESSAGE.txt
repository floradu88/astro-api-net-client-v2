fix: resolve 405 errors for general report endpoints and fix 404 for general house report

This commit fixes API availability issues for three general report endpoints
that were returning 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors due to incorrect data
format, and resolves a 404 (Not Found) error for the general house report
endpoint.

## Problem
- General Ascendant Report, General Sign Report, and General House Report
  were returning 405 errors with validation messages indicating missing
  "day" field
- General House Report was returning 404 error due to missing /tropical suffix

## Root Cause
The general report endpoints require a "hybrid" data format:
- Primary person data uses simple field names (day, month, year) instead of
  prefixed names (p_day, p_month, p_year)
- Secondary person data uses s_ prefix (s_day, s_month, s_year)
- This differs from other composite endpoints which use p_ prefix for primary

## Solution

### 1. Added Hybrid Format Converter
- Added ConvertToHybridFormat() method to FormDataConverter
- Supports both CompositeBirthData and two BirthData objects overloads
- Converts primary person to simple format (day/month/year)
- Keeps secondary person in s_ format (s_day/s_month/s_year)

### 2. Updated API Client Methods
- Updated GetGeneralAscendantReportAsync to use hybrid format
- Updated GetGeneralSignReportAsync to use hybrid format
- Updated GetGeneralHouseReportAsync to use hybrid format
- Added /tropical suffix to general_house_report endpoint path

### 3. Enhanced Test Coverage
- Updated tests to use new overloads with two BirthData objects
- Enhanced error reporting to capture full URLs and responses for 404/405 errors
- Added detailed error response sections in API availability report

### 4. Documentation
- Added IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with comprehensive documentation
- Added INVESTIGATION_405_Errors.md with problem analysis
- Updated API_Availability_Report.md with test results

## Results
- All 28 API endpoints are now accessible (100% success rate)
- General Ascendant Report: ✅ Fixed (was 405, now working)
- General Sign Report: ✅ Fixed (was 405, now working)
- General House Report: ✅ Fixed (was 404, now working)
